In a world where artificial reality dominates and the mind is free to exist in digital space, cybernetic shells, or cryostasis dreamscapes, those who remain trapped in their original human bodies are known as Slugsâ€”a derogatory yet widely accepted term for organic, non-augmented, flesh-bound humans.

The nickname comes from their slower reaction times, weaker physical endurance, and inability to interface directly with The System without external devices. 

While AI and neural-linked users process data at hyper-efficient speeds, Slugs must rely on manual input, limited sensory processing, and outdated organic cognition.
