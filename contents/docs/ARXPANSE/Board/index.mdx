A faceless executive council of corporate overlords who determine the fate of entire civilizations. 

The Board is said to govern the revival process, AI management, and economic optimization, ensuring 
that humanity remains profitable, productive, and compliant. 

No one knows their names, and those who ask too many questions tend to vanish.
