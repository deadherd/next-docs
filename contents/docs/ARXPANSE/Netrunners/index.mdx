## Cybernetic Security, Digital Warfare & AI Infiltration

The Netrunners are the ghosts in the machine. Masters of cyber warfare, AI manipulation, and data sabotage, they ensure the system bends to their will. 

Some work as corporate enforcers, protecting high-level data structures and artificial intelligence networks. Others break through firewalls, bypass security grids, and extract information from places no human should reach.

To The Board, they are security specialists. 

To the System, they are a necessary evil. 

To those who truly understand? They are the last free minds left.
