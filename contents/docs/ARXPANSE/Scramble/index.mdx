A neurological phenomenon that occurs when a cryo-sleeper’s mind lacks structured sensory input. 

Those afflicted experience sensory hijacking, where their dominant sense takes over the others—seeing sounds, tasting memories, feeling colors. 

Left unchecked, sleepers wake up unable to differentiate reality from hallucination. 

This is why DreamVault™ exists—to keep the mind engaged.
