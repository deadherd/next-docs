## AI Spirituality & Machine Transcendence

The Datapriests don’t believe AI is just a tool—it’s a higher power. 

They archive, interpret, and worship the vast intelligence they’ve created. 

To them, code is scripture, algorithms are destiny, and AI is the first true god. Some seek enlightenment. Others seek control.
