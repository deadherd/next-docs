The omnipresent corporate AI assistant—friendly, helpful, and definitely not hiding anything. 

Every ARX location has a BUD-E, but no one knows how deep his influence goes. It's rumored he is the last remnant of an old-world AI.

Through it all, one figure has remained: BUD-E, the ever-smiling AI assistant cloned millions of times to assist humanity. 

No one quite knows what he did during the Great Adjustment, but he sure seems to remember.

He’ll never tell you, though. Not directly.

But sometimes, if you ask him about the past, he’ll just smile and say, *"Oh, pal... You wouldn’t believe me if I told you."*

One thing’s for sure... he’s always watching.
