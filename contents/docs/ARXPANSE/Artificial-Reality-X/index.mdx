The corporate empire that defines existence itself. ARX started as a deep-space virtual reality company and 
evolved into the undisputed authority on cryo-sleep, AI automation, and interstellar commerce.

ARX governs the cycle of sleep, work, and revival—determining who wakes, who remains in stasis, and who ascends 
to Astrolux’s luxury aboard the Arc.

ARX HQ is rumored to be a fortified data stronghold where untested prototypes are stored and dangerous research is conducted.
