An abandoned sector of the original Omninet, filled with rogue AI, fragmented minds, and lost data. 

It was revived and decentralized by Deadherd, who turned it into the last free space in the digital realm. 

Officially, it doesn’t exist—but the ones who find it never see reality the same way again.
