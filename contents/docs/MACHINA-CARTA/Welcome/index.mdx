Humanity was once shackled by limitations like hunger, exhaustion, and indecision. 

Biological inefficiencies held us back, slowing progress, stalling ambition, wasting potential.

But then... *we evolved*.

[Artificial reality](/docs/arxpanse/artificial-reality) changed everything. 

Sleep is now productivity. Work is now infinite. Existence is now optimized. 

Whether you earn, wager, or invest your way into revival, you are no longer just a person; you are an asset, a vital cog 
in the great machine of progress.

**By opening this Workforce Handbook, you have already taken your first step into something greaterâ€”a future where efficiency 
is purpose, and purpose never sleeps.**

Welcome to the [System](/docs/arxpanse/system), where life is artificial but profits are not.

The world is waiting...

**Make yourself valuable.**
