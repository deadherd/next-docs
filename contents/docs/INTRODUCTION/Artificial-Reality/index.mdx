### Artificial Reality X (ARX)

ARX is the company that took escapism and survival and mashed them together into the 
greatest corporate success story in history.

### Artificial Reality

Due to ARX's success, "artificial reality" became a generic term for AI-powered existence.

### Space Travel

In the near future, humanity dared to dream beyond the stars—only to realize long-haul space travel was unbearably dull and 
physically destructive. Astronauts aged, muscles atrophied, and long journeys left colonists withering in isolation.

That’s where ARX came in. A small-time (mega-funded) startup with a simple but revolutionary solution: Deep Space VR Immersion.

Why let colonists rot in solitude when they could live entire simulated lives inside custom-built utopias while their bodies 
rested?

*Simple. Efficient. Safe.*

But survival has never been enough for The Board.

If they could keep paying travelers alive, why stop there?
