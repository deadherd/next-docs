**Artificial Reality—the company that took escapism and survival and mashed them together into the 
greatest corporate success story in history. Akin to Kleenex or Band-Aid but for existence.**

### The Dream That Started It All

In the near future, humanity dared to dream beyond the stars—only to realize long-haul space travel was unbearably dull and 
physically destructive. Astronauts aged, muscles atrophied, and long journeys left colonists withering in isolation.

That’s where Artificial Reality came in.

A small-time (mega-funded) startup with a simple but revolutionary solution: **Deep Space VR Immersion**.

Why let colonists rot in solitude when they could live entire simulated lives inside custom-built utopias while their bodies 
rested in cold storage?

Simple. Efficient. Safe-*ish*.

**But survival has never been enough for The Board.**

If we could keep travelers comfortable, why stop there? 

If we could preserve people for years, why not... *longer?*

## Death 2.0

### Cryotech

The human body is fragile. Radiation exposure, muscle degradation, and the minor inconvenience of aging made 
long-term space travel a logistical nightmare.

The answer? Cryonics.

Early cryo-freeze trials were spectacular failures. Tissue damage. Organ collapse. A few unfortunate cases of "freezer burn." 
But ARX (then a VR-focused subsidiary of ARC) had a breakthrough.

### Nanotech

Using nanite-assisted cryostasis, our scientists developed a way to flash-freeze organic tissue without turning customers 
into meat popsicles. 

The nanites (which absolutely *do not* self-replicate in unauthorized ways, corporate assures us) would 
actively repair frozen cells, allowing sleepers to be revived decades—even centuries—later without the pesky issue of death.

Cryo wasn’t just a game-changer—it was a galactic reset button.

At first, it was reserved for deep-space pioneers, ensuring they survived the voyages between the stars. But then someone in 
R&D (now frozen for legal reasons) asked a simple question:

> Why just use cryo for space travel? Why not put everyone in cryo?

And just like that, cryo-sleep went mainstream.

### Neuroplastic Hypercompensation

At first, it seemed like the perfect system—until we learned about the "scramble".

Turns out, when a person is left unstimulated for too long, the dominant sense hijacks the others. 

Early sleepers who spent decades in cold storage would wake up seeing sounds, tasting memories, or experiencing touch as 
waves of light.

Some emerged convinced they were made of music, while others couldn’t differentiate between the physical 
world and hallucinations their brains had created to fill the void.

One particularly unfortunate case involved a sleeper who woke up believing his consciousness had been stretched across 
every star in the sky.

RIP Omnipresent Paul.

## The Dream Age

### Where Sleeping Became the Ultimate Lifestyle

The solution to the scramble? Total neural immersion.

ARX developed Dreamscapes, fully interactive simulations designed to keep the sleeping mind occupied and ensure no one woke up as a scrambled mess of distorted perception.

**Sleepers could now:**

* **Live entire digital lives** inside hyper-realistic AI-generated worlds.
* **Customize their realities**—want to be a space cowboy? A billionaire? A space cowboy billionaire?
* **Rent out their frozen bodies** for profit, because why waste time sleeping when your consciousness can be leased?

Cryo stopped being a survival necessity and became a lifestyle upgrade.

The DreamVault™ became the ultimate status symbol, and soon, entire megacities emptied as millions opted out of reality.

The phrase *Put Me On Ice*™ became the ultimate life hack.

#### What did early adopters have to say?

> Wake me when Bitcoin hits a milli.

> I just need to skip five more election cycles.

> My favorite show got canceled—might as well fast-forward to the reboot.

> I’ll wake up when AI is legally required to do my taxes.

And so, while humanity slept… the world was rebuilt without them.

## The Big Expansion

### AI, Cryo, and the Rise of Astrolux

With the population sinking deeper into dream-world dependency, ARX took control of everything that mattered:

* **Cryo Infrastructure** – Built The Freezer Belt™, a vast network of sleeper banks stretching from Earth to the Moon.
* **Artificial Reality** – Created fully immersive Dreamscapes™, replacing dull, uninspired existence with something better™.
* **AI Workforce Automation** – Discovered that AI doesn’t unionize and built entire cities, factories, and economies while humans napped.
* **Financial Optimization** – Monetized every aspect of artificial existence through microtransactions, contracts, and life-extension packages.

At the center of it all? Astrolux Station.

What started as a simple interstellar trading post quickly became the busiest hub in the known galaxy. If you want resources, trade routes, or cryo services? The Board owns it. You rent it.

### The Secret Nanite Incident

Now, some (meaning government watchdogs, conspiracy theorists, and certain “missing” investigative reporters) have suggested that ARX’s miraculous advancements in cryotechnology may have involved unregulated, self-replicating nanites.

**We at ARX assure you:**

* There is no proof of unregistered nanotech development.
* There is no rogue swarm of hyper-intelligent microscopic machines rewriting human biology.
* There is no hidden failsafe protocol in case of unforeseen self-replication events.
* There is absolutely no reason to panic. Trust us.

### The Future of Sleeping Forever

**We believe in a world where:**

* Artificial Reality is the only reality worth living in.
* Cryo is the most efficient way to spend your existence.
* AI manages everything so you can focus on the important things.

Whether you’re freezing for financial gain, escaping responsibilities, or just hoping to wake up when Earth stops being an irradiated husk, ARX is here to ensure your transition is smooth, profitable, and heavily monetized in our favor.
