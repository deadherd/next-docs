The human body is fragile. Radiation exposure, muscle degradation, and the minor inconvenience of aging made 
long-term space travel a logistical nightmare.

Thus, cryostasis was born—after much trial and *terror*.

Early cryo-freeze trials were spectacular failures. Tissue damage. Organ collapse. A few unfortunate cases of "freezer burn."

But then a nanite-focused subsidiary of ARX had a breakthrough.

### Nanotech

Using nanite-assisted cryostasis, our scientists developed a way to flash-freeze organic tissue without turning customers 
into meat popsicles. 

The nanites (which absolutely *do not* self-replicate in unauthorized ways, corporate assures us) would 
actively repair frozen cells, allowing sleepers to be revived decades—theoretically centuries—later without the pesky issue of death.

Cryo wasn’t just a game-changer, it was a galactic reset button.

At first, it was reserved for deep space travel, ensuring they survived the voyages between bodies.

But then someone in R&D asked a simple question:

> Dude, existence is basically just like a series of ads, right? So what if cryo could be like getting the premium no-ads version... of life?

And just like that, cryo-sleep went mainstream.

### Cryo Revolution

Custom dreamscapes, cryo employment, cryo time travel, cryo prisons—investors wanted it *all*.

Eventually anyone could apply, even taking on debt that would be worked off with cryo employment.

Overall, humanity was using less resources, allowing Earth to heal from overpopulation.

People were escaping the dangers of real life while being able to experience hyperrealistic dreamlands custom tailored to Earth's timescale. Sleepers said it was "better than heaven".

It seemed like the perfect existence... until we learned about the "scramble".

<Note type="danger" title="Nanite Legal Notice">
  Some government watchdogs, conspiracy theorists, and certain “missing” investigative reporters have suggested that ARX’s 
  miraculous advancements in cryotechnology may have involved unregulated, self-replicating nanites or xenotechnology.
  We at ARX assure you:

  * There is *no* proof xenotech exists.
  * There is *no* proof of unregistered nanotech development.
  * There is *no* rogue swarm of hyper-intelligent microscopic machines rewriting human biology.
  * There is *no* hidden failsafe protocol in case of unforeseen self-replication events.
  * There is absolutely *no* reason to panic. Trust us.
