Astrolux Station orbits Earth. It is a colossal, corporate-controlled monument to humanity’s last great business deal. A one-stop shop for off-world resources, orbital trade routes, and cryo storage services.

From its high-tech halls, the Board guides a revival AI that determines who gets woken up, and who remains "on hold."

And recently, something incredible happened: Earth became habitable again.

With conditions improving, revivals have resumed, but not without controversy.

## Revival

The ultra-rich awaken first, having secured priority contracts centuries ago.

Corporations revive only the most useful workers.

The poor and unlucky remain frozen, waiting for a future that may never come.

And so begins the second age of humanity, not as a rebirth of civilization, but as a carefully optimized rollout of workforce assets.

But Earth is no longer the only home for mankind.

## Expansion

With the population sinking deeper into dream dependency, Astrolux allowed ARX to take control of everything that mattered:

* **Cryo Infrastructure** | Built The Freezer Belt™, a vast network of sleeper banks that circle the Earth in a ring.
* **Artificial Reality** | Created fully immersive Dreamscapes, replacing dull, uninspired existence with something better.
* **AI Workforce Automation** | Discovered that AI doesn’t unionize and built entire cities, factories, and economies while humans napped.
* **Financial Optimization** | Monetized every aspect of artificial existence through microtransactions, contracts, and life-extension packages.

## Governance

As Astrolux and ARX consolidated power into technocracy, humanity’s remaining workforce fragmented. 

The sleepers became a commodity, their frozen minds fueling an empire, while those who managed the system—the engineers, programmers, enforcers, 
and opportunists—split into divisions, each serving a different function within the new corporate hierarchy.

**No government. No nations. Just divisions, bound by contract and purpose.**
