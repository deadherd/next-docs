**The ARX system doesn’t just revive bodies, it revives purpose**.

Every awakened individual must serve a function, contributing to progress, optimization, and expansion.

The divisions of ARX are more than just career options—they are your identity, your survival, and your legacy within The System.

## Benefits

* ✅ **Your Revival Depends on It** – The System prioritizes productive citizens. Earn your place.
* ✅ **Automation Needs Operators** – AI does the heavy lifting, but who tells it what to do? That’s you.
* ✅ **Climbing the Ranks Means Power** – Workers obey. Executives decide. Where will you stand?
* ✅ **Influence the Future** – Divisons control policies, resources, and who wakes up next.

## Overview

### Netrunners

**Cybernetic Security & Digital Warfare**: This field specializes in offensive and defensive AI security, 
cybernetic infiltration, and real-time data warfare. They operate inside the code, manipulating digital landscapes, 
hacking AI itself, and ensuring the flow of data remains under control.

### Neuromancers

**Synthetic Cognition & Consciousness**: This field focuses on true artificial consciousness, emotional intelligence, and synthetic autonomy. It moves beyond 
decision trees and neural networks into the realm of self-awareness, personal agency, and AI-driven philosophy.

### Terraformers

**Autonomous Infrastructure & Self-Evolving Systems**: This branch deals with self-sustaining, self-improving AI systems that manage physical and digital infrastructure without 
human intervention. The goal: cities, networks, and societies that maintain themselves.
