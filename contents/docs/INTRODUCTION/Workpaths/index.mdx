**The ARX system doesn’t just revive bodies-it revives purpose**.

Every awakened individual must serve a function within the system, contributing to progress, optimization, and expansion.

The factions of ARX are more than just career choices—they are your identity, your survival, and your legacy within the Technocracy.

## Benefits

* ✅ **Your Revival Depends on It** – The System prioritizes productive citizens. Earn your place.
* ✅ **Automation Needs Operators** – AI does the heavy lifting, but who tells it what to do? That’s you.
* ✅ **Climbing the Ranks Means Power** – Workers obey. Executives decide. Where will you stand?
* ✅ **Influence the Future** – Factions control policies, resources, and who wakes up next.
