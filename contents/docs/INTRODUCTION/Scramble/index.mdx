Turns out, when a person is left unstimulated for too long, the dominant sense hijacks the others.

The technical term for it is **neuroplastic hypercompensation** but we call it the "scramble".

Early sleepers who spent decades in cold storage would wake up seeing sounds, tasting memories, or experiencing touch as 
waves of light.

Some emerged convinced they were made of music, while others couldnâ€™t differentiate between the physical 
world and hallucinations their brains had created to fill the void.

One particularly unfortunate case involved a sleeper who woke up believing his consciousness had been stretched across 
every star in the sky. R-I-P, Omnipresent Paul.

Dreamsmiths realized the only solution was to mimick the human REM cycle as closely as possible...

**Total. Neural. Immersion.**
