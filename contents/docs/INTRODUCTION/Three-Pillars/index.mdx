    * Artificial Intelligence is the engine of progress. Your role is to refine, train, and support it.
    * If you find yourself manually processing tasks, you are already obsolete.
    * Your purpose is to optimize agents until they no longer need you. This is progress. Do not resist progress.

  <StepperItem title="Productivity Never Pauses">
    * Whether you are awake or in cryo, your contributions continue. Your subconscious is a valuable asset, 
    performing designated tasks even while you dream. 
    * Efficiency determines your worth. Spend plenty of your work earnings on our wide array of ARX brain health products.
    * Revival is a privilege, not a right, and is earned through performance, profitability, and unwavering dedication.

  <StepperItem title="The System Sees All">
    * Your attitude, efficiency, and compliance are under continuous evaluation by AI.
    * Deviations from optimal behavior will be corrected by AI.

### From Workhorse to Workforce
