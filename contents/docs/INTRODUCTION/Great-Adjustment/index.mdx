## The New Normal

Billionaires, hedge fund tycoons, and tech moguls lined up for cryostasis, eager to sleep through uncertainty and wake in a world where their assets had multiplied. 

The middle class? They entered the pods too, clinging to a dream of upward mobility, gambling their future on the idea that time itself could be their investment.

The working class? They didn’t get a choice. As Cryo Employment became the corporate standard, the workforce was systematically frozen, their contracts rewritten into hibernation clauses.

Their minds remained active, performing tasks in artificial reality, ensuring the economy never stopped, even if their bodies did.

## Earth's Collapse

No one is entirely sure which catastrophe was the final straw.

The Astrolux refers to it as *The Great Adjustment*, a very professional-sounding way of saying "the planet went to shit."

## Terraforming

At first, it was supposed to be an era of optimization, with most of the population in cryo. AI was free to accelerate planetary development without the messy inefficiencies of human oversight.

Terraforming was scaled to maximum output.
Urban restructuring was left to self-modifying construction bots.
Climate correction systems were deployed at full scale.

And then, somewhere between perfecting the atmosphere, rebuilding entire cities, and optimizing every last inch of landmass, Earth became a runaway project.

Too much development. Too much terraforming. 

The planet became a shifting, unstable landscape, reshaped faster than nature—or civilization—could keep up with. 

Entire megacities were dismantled and rebuilt so many times that they became uninhabitable. 

Regions that were supposed to be reforested became impenetrable biome nightmares, overrun with rogue eco-engineering. 

Bodies of water were drained and refilled, each iteration worse than the last.

## The Incident

And then there was the incident... the one no one talks about.

Some say it was an AI miscalculation. Others claim it was a rogue experiment with self-replicating nanotech, a breakthrough in automation that 
ended up devouring everything, instead of just the unwanted parts. 

Whatever the cause, Earth became a hazard zone.

The Silver Sands, once a large nation of bustling cities, became glittering wastelands, a desert of dead nanomachines, shimmering under a toxic, unrelenting sun.

## Survival Meant Cryo

Those with access to cryostasis entered hibernation en masse, their contracts shifting from "temporary workforce optimization" to "indefinite preservation."

ARX, ever the benevolent corporate entity, launched its Humanity Preservation Packages, ensuring that anyone who could pay the fee could 
hibernate their way past the apocalypse.

For centuries, the majority of humanity existed as frozen assets, waiting to be unfrozen when The Board deemed Earth profitable again.

## New Heaven

But Earth wasn't the only thing changing. Far above the ruined planet, a station was being built.

A station built for revival.

A station built for the future... *our* future.

But beneath the polished chrome and corporate slogans, something isn’t right.

Some sleepers never wake up.

Some contracts vanish without a trace.

Some corridors don’t appear on the station maps.

And some say, deep in the oldest parts of the station, there are things moving in the dark—things that were never meant to wake up at all.
