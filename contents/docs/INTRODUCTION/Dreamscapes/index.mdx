ARX developed Dreamscapes, fully interactive simulations designed to keep the sleeping mind occupied and ensure no one woke up as a scrambled mess of distorted perception. This allowed sleepers to:

* **Live entire digital lives** inside hyper-realistic AI-generated worlds.
* **Customize their realities**—want to be a space cowboy? A billionaire? A space cowboy billionaire?
* **Rent out their frozen bodies** for profit, because why waste time sleeping when your consciousness can be leased?

Cryo stopped being a survival necessity and became a lifestyle upgrade.

The DreamVault™ became the ultimate status symbol, and soon, entire megacities emptied as millions opted out of reality.

The phrase *Put Me On Ice*™ became the ultimate life hack.

And so, while humanity slept… the world was rebuilt without them. For better... or *worse*.

### Common Reasons for Sleeping

> Wake me when Bitcoin hits a milli.

> I just need to skip five more election cycles.

> My favorite show got canceled—might as well fast-forward to the reboot.

> I’ll wake up when AI is legally required to do my taxes.
